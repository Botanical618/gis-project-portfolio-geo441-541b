It can be useful to see the density differences as well as what the census density looked like in 2020 as a good reference point. For spatial and temporal resolutions, the scale and data are both recent and multi-leveled, so we can hone in on the Ohio region and view multiple levels of the data for our project. I think this source could be very useful."
